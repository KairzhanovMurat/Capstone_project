      <p>I had the same idea but when I tried that and it didn't work. The Jumbotron's background colour takes precedence over the bootstrap background colours. â€“

Yes this works. I created a class of .bg-jcol and added it to .jumbotron. Sometimes, you have to hold shift when resetting your web page to override the cached page. You will find the instructions in Bootstrap under the 'navbar' component. </p>
